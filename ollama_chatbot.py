    "Models\n",
    "How are models at Bitpredict developed?\nWe leverage a multidisciplinary approach, integrating various fields such as machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning to create robust and adaptive forecasting models followed by thorough backtesting, forwardtesting, and live simulation.\n\n",
    "Can I request a specific type of model or time horizon?\nWe value user feedback and suggestions. While we may not be able to fulfill every individual request, your input is crucial for our continuous improvement. Feel free to reach out through our contact channels with your suggestions.\n\n",
    "Are there any free models available on Bitpredict?\nYes, we offer free access to a selection of models. Users can explore and benefit from these models to understand our platforms capabilities before opting for premium features.\n\n",
    "How can I favorite models for later access?\nWe are actively working on introducing user management features, including the ability to favorite models for later access. Stay tuned for updates on this and more premium features.\n\n",
    "Why is there only Bitcoin forecasts?\nBitpredict was developed to provide a forward valuation for Bitcoin. However, the governing equations can be used for a variety of Proof of Work digital assets. In the future Bitpredict will release forecasts for a range of alternative cryptocurrencies.\n\n",
    "What time zone is used for forecasts?\nUTC, however all models reference your local machine clock.\n\n",
    "How have the ZT models been back tested?\nThe models have been thoroughly back tested on both seen and unseen data sets. The metrics shown on the website are a combination of the back tested results and the inclusion of live data moving forward. Every day new metrics are calculated based on the live performance of the previous day.\n\n",
    "Where do I find the accuracy statistics per model?\nThe accuracy of any model can be viewed directly at the bottom of its individual page. There you will find the specific drawdown, win/loss metrics, and general statistics that make up the overall performance of a model.\n\n",
    "What are the ranking criteria between model forecasts?\nAt the moment models are ranked based on their total achieved yield. Please note that this may not be the optimal metric to rank models.\n\n",
    "Performance\n",
    "How accurate are the forecasts on Bitpredict?\nForecast accuracy can vary based on market conditions, and it is important to note that cryptocurrency markets inherently involve risks. Our models undergo continuous refinement to enhance accuracy, and users can refer to backtest analyses for historical performance insights.\n\n",
    "Can I customize parameters for backtesting on Bitpredict?\nAbsolutely! Our Backtest page allows users to customize parameters such as take profit, stop loss, fee, and time stop. This customization empowers users to tailor backtests according to their trading preferences.\n\n",
    "What is the significance of the R2 score in the backtest analysis?\nThe R2 score measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (actual PNL) that is predictable from the independent variables (forecasted PNL). A higher R2 score indicates a stronger relationship between forecasted and actual PNL.\n\n",
    "What is the significance of the Shape metric in backtest analysis?\nThe Shape metric, also known as the Sharpe ratio, assesses the risk-adjusted performance of a model. It provides insight into whether the returns of the model are due to a smart investment strategy or excessive risk. A higher Shape ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns, making it a crucial metric for evaluating performance.\n\n",
    "How is the Sortino ratio important in assessing model performance?\nThe Sortino ratio, similar to the Sharpe ratio, measures risk-adjusted performance but focuses solely on the downside risk. It considers only the standard deviation of negative returns, providing a more insightful view of a models ability to withstand market downturns. A higher Sortino ratio suggests better downside risk management.\n\n",
    "What does the Alpha metric indicate in backtesting?\nAlpha represents the models excess return compared to its expected return, considering the inherent risks in the market. A positive alpha indicates the model has outperformed expectations, while a negative alpha suggests underperformance. It is a valuable metric for assessing a models ability to generate returns beyond what is predicted by its beta.\n\n",
    "How does the Beta metric contribute to backtest analysis?\nBeta measures a model sensitivity to market movements compared to a benchmark, often the overall market. A beta of 1 implies the model moves in sync with the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility. A beta less than 1 suggests lower volatility. Understanding beta is crucial for assessing how a model reacts to market fluctuations.\n\n",
    "What role do the 18 evaluation metrics play in backtest analysis?\nThe 18 evaluation metrics, including Shape, Sortino, Alpha, and Beta, provide a comprehensive view of a model performance. These metrics cover various aspects, such as drawdown, win/loss ratio, positive/negative PNL, and R2. Evaluating these metrics collectively allows users to gauge the model strengths and weaknesses across different dimensions, aiding in informed decision-making.\n\n",
    "What does long and short mean?\nIn futures trading lingo, long means one is buying a positive contract (if the price increases, one makes money from the appreciation and if the price decreases one losses money from the depreciation). The opposite of long is a short, where one is buying a negative contract (if the price decreases one makes money from the depreciation and if the price increases, one loses money from the appreciation).\n\n",
    "What time do the hypothetical trades open and close?\nPositions are typically opened and closed only if the model predicts a directional change.\n\n",
    "Why are there no risk controls (stop loss/take profit) being applied to the directional forecast of the models?\nOur goal is to prove that models resulting from the Bitpredict governing equations do produce superior foresight and performance without the need of risk control interventions. Risk controls themselves should only enhance a modelâ€™s already inherent performance to drive up yield consistency and reduce drawdown intensity and durations.\n\n",
    "Are trading fees taken into account within the performance analysis?\nNo. Trading fees are not taken into account as of yet. There will be a feature in the future that will allow users to observe the impact of trading fees for all individual models.\n\n",
    "How do we use the Bitpredict models to make money?\nWe do not provide financial or investment advice. Please treat the content of this entire website as an academic exercise to prove the existence of a robust pricing theory for Bitcoin.\n\n",
    "About\n",
